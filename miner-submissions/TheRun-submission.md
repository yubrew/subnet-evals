Critical:

1. Reentrancy vulnerability in the Participate function (lines 90-108): The contract sends Ether before updating state variables, allowing potential reentrancy attacks.
   solidity

```solidity
payable(players[Payout_id].addr).transfer(Last_Payout); //pay the man, please !
Balance -= players[Payout_id].payout; //update the balance
players[Payout_id].paid=true;
```

High:

2. Insecure random number generation (lines 112-121):
   The random function uses block properties that can be manipulated by miners, making it predictable.

```solidity
function random(uint256 Max) private view returns (uint256) {
// ... uses block.timestamp, block.difficulty, block.number ...
}
```

3. Unchecked arithmetic operations (throughout the contract): The contract doesn't use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8.0+ checked arithmetic, potentially leading to overflow/underflow issues.

Medium:

4. Centralization risk (lines 148-150):
   The ChangeOwnership function allows the owner to transfer ownership without any checks or delays.

```solidity
function ChangeOwnership(address _owner) public onlyowner {
admin = _owner;
}
```

5. Lack of input validation in GetAndReduceFeesByFraction (lines 168-171): There's no check to ensure 'p' is within a valid range (0-1000).

```solidity
function GetAndReduceFeesByFraction(uint p) public onlyowner {
// ... no validation for 'p' ...
}
```

Low:

6. Inconsistent use of transfer and call for sending Ether (throughout the contract):
   The contract uses both transfer and call for sending Ether, which can lead to inconsistent gas behavior.

Lack of events for important state changes (throughout the contract): The contract doesn't emit events for important actions like payouts or fee collection, reducing transparency.
Informational: 8. Unused return values (lines 183-209):
Several functions declare return variables but don't use them in the function body.

Inconsistent naming conventions (throughout the contract): The contract mixes camelCase and snake_case naming conventions, which reduces code readability.

7. TODO comment left in code (line 124):

```solidity
// for testing purposes TODO remove before production
```

This function should be removed or properly secured before deployment.
These issues vary in their potential impact on the contract's security and functionality. The critical and high severity issues should be addressed immediately before any deployment, while the others should be considered for improving the contract's overall quality and security.
